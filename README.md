# Mars Weather App

[Mars Weather App](https://weather-on-mars-elysium-plantitia.netlify.app/) is a front-end react project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It shows the latest 7-day weather on Mars at Elysium Plantitia. The data is fetched through NASA's API--Insight, which can be found on [NASA's API list](https://api.nasa.gov/).

This is created based on the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQVR2M3IxMs) with some modifications on style and redux.
